# WordNet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaText/WordNet.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaText/WordNet.jl)

A Julia package for using Princeton's [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)Â®, heavily inspired by [Doches](https://github.com/doches)' [rwordnet](https://github.com/doches/rwordnet).

## Simple Demo

```juila
using WordNet
db = DB()
```
> WordNet.DB

```juila
lemma = db['a', "glad"]
```
> glad.a

```julia
ss = synsets(db, lemma)
```
> 4-element Array{WordNet.Synset,1}:
> (a) glad (showing or causing joy and pleasure; especially made happy; "glad you are here"; "glad that they succeeded"; "gave a glad shout"; "a glad smile"; "heard the glad news"; "a glad occasion")
> (s) happy, glad (eagerly disposed to act or to be of service; "glad to help")
> (s) glad (feeling happy appreciation; "glad of the fire's warmth")
> (s) glad, beaming (cheerful and bright; "a beaming smile"; "a glad May morning")

```julia
antonyms(db, ss[1])
```
> 1-element Array{WordNet.Synset,1}:
> (a) sad (experiencing or showing sorrow or unhappiness; "feeling sad because his dog had died"; "Better by far that you should forget and smile / Than that you should remember and be sad"- Christina Rossetti)

```julia
expanded_hypernyms(db, synsets(db, db['n', "DOG"])[1])
```
> 13-element Array{WordNet.Synset,1}:
> (n) canine, canid (any of various fissiped mammals with nonretractile claws and typically long muzzles)
> (n) carnivore (a terrestrial or aquatic flesh-eating mammal; "terrestrial carnivores have four or five clawed digits on each limb")
> (n) eutherian mammal, placental, placental mammal, eutherian (mammals having a placenta; all mammals except monotremes and marsupials)
> (n) mammalian, mammal (any warm-blooded vertebrate having the skin more or less covered with hair; young are born alive except for the small subclass of monotremes and nourished with milk)
> (n) vertebrate, craniate (animals having a bony or cartilaginous skeleton with a segmented spinal column and a large brain enclosed in a skull or cranium)
> (n) chordate (any animal of the phylum Chordata having a notochord or spinal column)
> (n) animal, creature, animate being, brute, beast, fauna (a living organism characterized by voluntary movement)
> (n) organism, being (a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently)
> (n) living thing, animate thing (a living (or once living) entity)
> (n) unit, whole (an assemblage of parts that is regarded as a single entity; "how big is that part compared to the whole?"; "the team is a unit")
> (n) physical object, object (a tangible and visible entity; an entity that can cast a shadow; "it was full of rackets, balls and other objects")
> (n) physical entity (an entity that has physical existence)
> (n) entity (that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving))

```julia
sensekey(db, synsets(db, db['n', "cat"])[1], db['n', "cat"])
```
> "cat%1:05:00::"

```julia
sensekeys(db, db['n', "cat"])
```
>8-element Array{SubString{String},1}:
>"cat%1:05:00::"
>"cat%1:18:01::"
>"cat%1:18:00::"
>"cat%1:06:02::"
>"cat%1:06:00::"
>"cat%1:06:01::"
>"cat%1:05:02::"
>"cat%1:04:00::"


## Design consideration
This package loads all of WordNet into memory. It's not terribly expensive, but it may not be suitable for all developers.

## Wordnet Data
The constructor `DB` can optionally take a path to a WordNet directory, containing a `dict` folder.
This should work for any release of WordNet.
If you do not specify such a path, WordNet 3.0 will automatically be downloaded the first time you call `DB()`.
It will only be downloaded once.
See [DataDeps.jl's readme for more information](https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl).
